# Anomaly Detection Algorithms

## Overview
This research employs two distinct groups of algorithms:
1. Algorithms that utilize datasets with **categorical and numerical features**.
2. Algorithms that utilize only **numerical features**.

The directories associated with this file contain selected source codes used in this research, as well as references to the libraries applied during the experiments.

## Implementation Details
